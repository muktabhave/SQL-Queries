Table: Buses

+--------------+------+
| Column Name  | Type |
+--------------+------+
| bus_id       | int  |
| arrival_time | int  |
+--------------+------+
bus_id is the column with unique values for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about the arrival time of a bus at the LeetCode station.
No two buses will arrive at the same time.
 

Table: Passengers

+--------------+------+
| Column Name  | Type |
+--------------+------+
| passenger_id | int  |
| arrival_time | int  |
+--------------+------+
passenger_id is the column with unique values for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about the arrival time of a passenger at the LeetCode station.
 

Buses and passengers arrive at the LeetCode station. If a bus arrives at the station at time tbus and a passenger arrived at time tpassenger where tpassenger <= tbus and the passenger did not catch any bus, the passenger will use that bus.

Write a solution to report the number of users that used each bus.

Return the result table ordered by bus_id in ascending order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Buses table:
+--------+--------------+
| bus_id | arrival_time |
+--------+--------------+
| 1      | 2            |
| 2      | 4            |
| 3      | 7            |
+--------+--------------+
Passengers table:
+--------------+--------------+
| passenger_id | arrival_time |
+--------------+--------------+
| 11           | 1            |
| 12           | 5            |
| 13           | 6            |
| 14           | 7            |
+--------------+--------------+
Output: 
+--------+----------------+
| bus_id | passengers_cnt |
+--------+----------------+
| 1      | 1              |
| 2      | 0              |
| 3      | 3              |
