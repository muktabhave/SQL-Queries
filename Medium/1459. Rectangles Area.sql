/* Write an SQL query to report of all possible rectangles which can be formed by any two points of the table. 

Each row in the result contains three columns (p1, p2, area) where:

p1 and p2 are the id of two opposite corners of a rectangle and p1 < p2.
Area of this rectangle is represented by the column area.
Report the query in descending order by area in case of tie in ascending order by p1 and p2.*/

Table: Points

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| x_value       | int     |
| y_value       | int     |
+---------------+---------+
id is the column with unique values for this table.
Each point is represented as a 2D coordinate (x_value, y_value).
 

Write a solution to report all possible axis-aligned rectangles with a non-zero area that can be formed by any two points from the Points table.

Each row in the result should contain three columns (p1, p2, area) where:

p1 and p2 are the id's of the two points that determine the opposite corners of a rectangle.
area is the area of the rectangle and must be non-zero.
Return the result table ordered by area in descending order. If there is a tie, order them by p1 in ascending order. If there is still a tie, order them by p2 in ascending order.

The result format is in the following table.

 

Example 1:


Input: 
Points table:
+----------+-------------+-------------+
| id       | x_value     | y_value     |
+----------+-------------+-------------+
| 1        | 2           | 7           |
| 2        | 4           | 8           |
| 3        | 2           | 10          |
+----------+-------------+-------------+
Output: 
+----------+-------------+-------------+
| p1       | p2          | area        |
+----------+-------------+-------------+
| 2        | 3           | 4           |
| 1        | 2           | 2           |

Explanation: 
The rectangle formed by p1 = 2 and p2 = 3 has an area equal to |4-2| * |8-10| = 4.
The rectangle formed by p1 = 1 and p2 = 2 has an area equal to |2-4| * |7-8| = 2.
Note that the rectangle formed by p1 = 1 and p2 = 3 is invalid because the area is 0.

ANS:

select 
pa.id as p1, 
pb.id as p2, 
abs(pa.x_value  -pb.x_value )*abs(pa.y_value  -pb.y_value ) as area
from
points pa join points pb
on (pa.id< pb.id)
where abs(pa.x_value  -pb.x_value )*abs(pa.y_value  -pb.y_value )>0
order by area desc, pa.id, pb.id
